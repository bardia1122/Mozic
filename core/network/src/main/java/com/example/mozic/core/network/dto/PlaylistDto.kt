 * rejects anything else. `cover_image_url` is omitted (nullable column, no
 * cover at creation time).
 *
 * [isPublic]/[category] deliberately have no default value even though every
 * caller passes the same constant: the shared `Json`'s `encodeDefaults` is
 * unset (defaults to `false`), so a property left at its Kotlin default is
 * silently dropped from the request body — harmless for `is_public` (the
 * `playlists` table itself defaults it to `true`) but fatal for `category`,
 * which has no DB-side default and is `not null`; PostgREST then rejects the
 * insert with a null-constraint violation. Making both required forces
 * kotlinx.serialization to always encode them regardless of that setting.
